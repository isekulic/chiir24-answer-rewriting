# Towards Self-Contained Answers: Entity-Based Answer Rewriting in Conversational Search

This repository contains conversational information-seeking (CIS) data from [QReCC]([url](https://github.com/apple/ml-qrecc)), with annotated sample of 360 question-answer pairs to characterize entity saliency in CIS.
Moreover, we realease crowd workers' assessments of answer rewrite type preferences. These include both the specific type preferred and a reason for choosing the specific type in textual format.


The resources in the repository are developed for our CHIIR'24 paper: "Towards Self-Contained Answers: Entity-Based Answer Rewriting in Conversational Search", by Ivan Sekulić<sup>1</sup>, Krisztian Balog<sup>2</sup>, and Fabio Crestani<sup>1</sup>.
